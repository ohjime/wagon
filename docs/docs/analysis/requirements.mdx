# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system should do â€” features, behaviors, and rules from a system or product perspective.

**Functional Requirements** are closely related to **user stories**, but differ in their target audience and scope. Functional requirements are more **precise**, **formal** than user stories and are aimed to be written for developers, testers, and technical-minded stakeholders. User Stories are usually much **shorter** and **casual** than Functional Requirements that serve as **conversational** prompts for discussion in Agile teams.

:::note
One or more functional requirements can be grouped under a single user story. If there are multiple functional requirements under a single user story, they often serve as starter task entries in a Sprint's Taskboard.

**Functional Requirements (dated 08/04/2025):**

1. Users should be able to input a start location and a destination and get an estimate fare
2. User should be able to request a ride based on an estimate
3. Drivers should be able to navigate to the pickup/drop-off locations of their scheduled trip

Out of scope requirements are requirements that are desirable to our project, but not something that can be currently implemented for whatever reason.

***Out of Scope* Functional Requirements (dated 08/04/2025):**

1. Multiple Car Types
2. Ratings for drivers and riders

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs a certain function. They are often referred to as **quality attributes**, **quality of service requirements**, or **constraints**.

Non-functional requirements dont map very well to user stories as their scope is purely technical.

:::note
It can be tricky to determine whether a requirement is functional or non-functional. The best rule of thumb is that if overall theme of the requirement sounds like a buzzword that ends with **"-ity"** (e.g. *scalability*, *availability*, *integrity* etc.), then it's probably a non-functional requirement.

1. Schedule Generation should take less than 60 minutes
1. Trip Updates should have a latency of less than 5 seconds
1. Handle high surges during peak hours or special events, with an upper bound on API calls set to 10,000 request an hour (see research reference)
